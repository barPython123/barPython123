# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
It's a pleasure to be here, my name is Greg (he) and Im on a path to becoming a developer!

## Little about me

My current working language is Typescript, but I also dabble in Rust for future proofing my backed dev career.<br>
I spent the last 12 years working behind bars in various cocktail bars and clubs in Warsaw/ Poland.

### TLDR;
I'm currently working on GymCat -> TS/React workout logger for keeping track of my exercise regimen.<br>
I'm still learning TypeScript but occasionally Im doing a little Rust<br>
I'll gladly join an open-source project to develop my skills and expand my experience working with more senior developers!
