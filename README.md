### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Its a pleasure to be here, my name is Greg (he) and im on path to becoming developer!

## Little about me
My current language is Typescript, but I also dabble in Rust for future proofing my backed dev career.<br>
I spent last 12 year working behind bar in various cocktail bars and clubs in Warsaw/ Poland.

## TLDR;
I'm currently working on GymCat -> TS/React workout logger for keeping track of exercise regiment.<br>
I'm still learning TypeScript but ocassionaly Im doing a little Rust<br>
I'll gladly join open source project to develop my skills and expend my exprience working with more sernior developers!
