# Hi there 👋
It's a pleasure to be here, my name is Greg and Im working towards moving to full time job as software engineer !

## Little about me

My working stack is TS / React / Mongo / Node<br>
I spent the last 12 years working behind bars in various cocktail bars and clubs in Warsaw/Poland and London.

## Experience
For the last 2,5 years, I expend my knowledge of JS/TS, concurrently learning about good software practices, databases, web standards, algorithms and more.<br>
As a long-time ( 14+ years ) Linux / Mac user I'm not afraid of searching for solutions to problems and enjoy doing things in a good way, not the short way.

## Engineer motivation
I want to create software that allows its users to grow.<br>
Applications and solutions that are expending human interactions and deliver good emotions. 

## Nerdy Things

Vim motions enthusiast ⌨️
WebStorm daily driver ⚡
Zellji > Tmux
WezTerm > Alacritty

## TLDR;
I'm self-taught developer that thrives in good logic riddles<br>
I'm still learning TypeScript but occasionally Im doing a little Rust<br>
I'll gladly join an open-source project to develop my skills and expand my experience working with more senior developers!
