# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
It's a pleasure to be here, my name is Greg (he) and Im on a path to becoming a developer!

## Little about me

My current working language is Typescript, but I also dabble in Rust for future proofing my backed dev career.<br>
I spent the last 12 years working behind bars in various cocktail bars and clubs in Warsaw/ Poland.

## Experience
For the last 1,5 years, I expend my knowledge of JS/TS, concurrently learning about good software practices, databases, web standards, algorithms and more.
As a long-time ( 14+ years ) Linux / Mac user I'm not afraid of searching for solutions to problems and enjoy doing things in a good way, not the short way. 

## Engineer motivation
I want to create software that allows its users to grow.<br>
Applications and solutions that are expending human interactions and deliver good emotions. 


## TLDR;
I'm currently working on GymCat -> TS/React workout logger for keeping track of my exercise regimen.<br>
I'm still learning TypeScript but occasionally Im doing a little Rust<br>
I'll gladly join an open-source project to develop my skills and expand my experience working with more senior developers!
